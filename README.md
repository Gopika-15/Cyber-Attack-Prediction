# Cyber-Attack-Prediction
 In this project, an online banking website is developed where the details of users and branches can be stored. The transaction records can be viewed by the users. The user can enter any URL to check if it is a phishing website. Also, if any DoS attack occurs, the user is blocked from the website.
